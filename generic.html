					<p>I grew up in Denver, Colorado during my early years, my family would bounce from house to house because we were never the most financially stable. Even so, my parents made sure we had everything we needed and that we never knew any better about our situation. I really enjoyed my childhood and honestly my parents did a good job, I never knew any better.</p>
					<p>In high school, I started to love computers, and started to wonder how I could learn more about them. There weren't that many classes to learn about computers at my high school, so I went to the internet to learn as much as I could. Outside of playing sports and maintaining a social life, I figured out how to host sites, do some HTML/CSS and learn the fundamentals of Java and Python. I found all of these things interesting and fell in love with development and more specifically front-end development. </p>
					<p>In college, I have joined a few organization and have been very involved in my community. I have joined AIS (Association of Information Systems) MSA (Muslim Student Association) and SRE (Society of Real Estate) which have all played an integral part in my development as a student and person. I have volunteered over 150 hours of my time towards Habitat for Humanity where I was helping families buy and build homes.</p>
